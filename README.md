# BAM to Mutation Rate Pipeline

### Developed for Ding Labs, Washington University Medical School

BAM to Mutation Rate Pipeline is a pipeline that takes in BAM, vcf, region-of-interest (roi), and fasta files and is able to return mutation rates for the specified regions of interest. This allows users to compare the mutation rates of a gene with background mutation rates, helping determine if the gene has been significantly mutated.

The pipeline runs through a bash file is titled 'mutation_calculator_remix.sh'
